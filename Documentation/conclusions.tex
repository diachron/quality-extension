\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This report contains the technical documentation regarding the first version of the WP3 services delivered in M16 of the DIACHRON project; these are the detection service, the repairing service and the cleaning service.
Apart from the technical documentation about the services, we also provided the final version of the specifications, with emphasis on any differences with respect to what was reported in Deliverable D3.1~\cite{d3.1}.
These services have already been implemented and are publicly deployed as a stand-alone module at 
\url{http://139.91.183.93:8181}. They will be also formally deployed as part of the integrated DIACHRON environment for Deliverable D6.2 in M20.
