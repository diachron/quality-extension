\section{Low-level Changes}
\label{app:lowlevel}

As reported in Deliverable D3.1~\cite{d3.1}, we have two low-level changes, one reporting triples that were added and one reporting triples that were deleted. These low-level changes refer to the representation of the dataset in the internal DIACHRON representation (under the DIACHRON model).

The low-level changes are stored in two specific named graphs within Virtuoso Server namely, \url{http://added} and \url{http://deleted}. Consider now the case in which we desire to detect the low-level changes among two dataset versions e.g., $V1$, $V2$. The corresponding SPARQL queries which will update the above named graphs will be: 
\begin{description}
\item [Added low-level changes:] 
INSERT INTO $<$http://added$>$ \{?s ?p ?o\} WHERE \{ \\
GRAPH $<$V2$>$ \{ ?s ?p ?o \} \\
FILTER NOT EXISTS \{ GRAPH $<$V1$>$ \{?s ?p ?o\} \}\\
\}

\item [Deleted low-level changes:] 
INSERT INTO $<$http://deleted$>$ \{?s ?p ?o\} WHERE \{ \\
GRAPH $<$V1$>$ \{ ?s ?p ?o \} \\
FILTER NOT EXISTS \{ GRAPH $<$V2$>$ \{?s ?p ?o\} \}\\
\}
\end{description}
